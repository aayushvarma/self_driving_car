# self_driving_car
Self-Driving car based on ultrasonic sensor (Arduino IDE), written in C++
You can do the connections based on the png file in the repo between the battery (tires) and the arduino and motor (if required) 
We have used ultrasonic sensors in our code, you may utilise infrared as well. Code changes (for infrared) are not included in my code. 
There is an additional separate code, just for testing the range/readings of the sensors. I have added for testing/ease (sens_reading)
The new_ping library is open-source. Can be taken from the internet as well from official Arduino website.
For all practical purposes use a large battery (9V +)
